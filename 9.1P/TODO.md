Based on the assignment, you need to submit a PDF report containing the following items:

1. **Requirements Section**
   - You already have this in the REQUIREMENT.md file with the user story for the Task Notification System

2. **Screenshots of TDD Development Steps**
   - You need screenshots showing:
     - Tests failing initially (Red phase)
     - Implementation making tests pass (Green phase)
     - Any refactoring you did while tests remained passing

3. **CI/CD Setup Evidence**
   - Screenshots of GitHub Actions configuration (which we've set up)
   - Screenshot showing failed build notification email when tests don't pass
   - Screenshot showing successful build notification email after all tests pass

4. **Source Code**
   - Include all source files we've created:
     - TaskNotificationService.java
     - TaskNotification.java
     - NotificationPriority.java
     - TaskNotificationTest.java
     - Main.java

5. **GitHub Repository Screenshot**
   - Screenshot of your GitHub page showing the repository with all these files committed

6. **TDD Discussion**
   - The TDD_REPORT.md already contains this discussion

To complete your assignment, you need to:

1. Create a GitHub repository and push your code
2. First push incomplete code that will make tests fail
3. Take screenshot of the failure notification email
4. Fix the code and push again
5. Take screenshot of the success notification email
6. Compile all these materials into a PDF report and submit it to OnTrack

Remember to set up email secrets in your GitHub repository for the notification feature to work correctly.
